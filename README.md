# Playwright testautomation project on [Tricentis Tosca webshop](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

## Getting started
Install nodejs >=18.0.0 and npm. Install the packages with npm -i. You can execute the test with `npm -i` in the project root folder.

## Why is this repository exist?
There are two key reasons for my interest. First, with several years of experience working with Selenium and .NET, I have observed a growing industry shift toward Playwright for UI testingâ€”especially in applications built with modern JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and React. To remain aligned with these evolving standards, I am keen to broaden my expertise in Playwright and TypeScript, enabling me to better support both current and future projects.

Second, developing proficiency in these technologies enhances my competitiveness in the job market by allowing me to confidently showcase relevant and up-to-date technical skills during interviews.

## Why Tricentis Tosca webshop?
I have an [another project in Cypress](https://github.com/RobertPecz/CypressPetProject) which using [automationpractice webshop](http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php) but it turned out that some functionalities of the page not developed correctly and it's very hard to handle by any test automation framework.

## Can I contribute?
No, if it's not a must, I like to keep this repository to myself. If you like to help me, please raise a ticket on the issues tab.
